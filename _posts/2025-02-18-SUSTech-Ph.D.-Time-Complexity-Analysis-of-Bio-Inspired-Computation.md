# Introduction

Applications are invited for a **fully-funded** PhD studentship on the runtime analysis of bioinspired
computation techniques such as evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, artificial immune systems
which are widely used heuristic search techniques at the heart of artificial intelligence.

# About the project

Bio-inspired meta-heuristics, such as evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms or artificial
immune systems are general-purpose algorithms that mimic powerful mechanisms from nature such
as the natural evolution of species or the collective intelligence of animals with the goal of
solving complex optimisation problems. They have been applied successfully to a broad range of
problems in various disciplines with remarkable success. They are particularly useful in settings
where limited knowledge about the problem is available (black-box optimisation) and evaluating
candidate solutions is the only means of learning about the problem at hand.

In recent years, theoretical analyses have emerged that provide mathematically proven statements
regarding the performance of bio-inspired algorithms. They rigorously estimate the expected time
required by the algorithms to find a satisfactory solution for various optimisation problems. Such
analyses use mathematical techniques drawn and extended from the fields of randomised algorithms,
probability theory and computational complexity. The results allow for insights into the working
principles of bio-inspired meta-heuristics, enable the assessment of parameter choices and design
aspects, and ultimately guide towards the design of more powerful algorithms. This studentship
offers a valuable opportunity to work within this very active, challenging and exciting field of
research at the intersection between theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
The successful applicant will perform high quality research in the area of time complexity analysis
at the interface between bio-inspired computation and artificial intelligence. During the PhD studies,
he/she will develop expertise in one or more promising research areas of his/her choice in this
wide research area.

# Possible topics include the performance analysis of:

- Population-based meta-heuristics: highlighting their advantages over single-trajectory algorithms
and/or the advantages of recombination over mutation-only algorithms;
- Algorithm configurators: how to evolve the optimal parameter settings for the meta-heuristic;
- Hyper-heuristics: how to evolve the meta-heuristic itself;
- Genetic programming: how to evolve computer programs effectively.

# About the University/Department

Established in 2010 with the mission to reform Chinese tertiary education and become a top-notch
international research university, SUSTech was launched in the tech capital city of Shenzhen.
SUSTech is becoming the important epicentre for China’s science and technology academic research
and for the cultivation of innovative minds. The rapid ascent of SUSTech onto the global stage is
remarkable. In the Times Higher Education (THE) World university Rankings 2023, it ranked 8th in
Mainland China and 166th among the universities in the world. In THE Young Universities Rankings
2024, SUSTech was ranked 1st in China.

The SUSTech campus sits in the rolling hills of Nanshan District, with the verdant green lawns
reflecting the environmentally friendly policies of the university. The natural and tranquil
environment combines perfectly with the modern style of Shenzhen and its convenient location. With
the campus covering an area of nearly 2 square kilometers, there is plenty of room for students to
cogitate and consider their research or relax and enjoy their lives on campus. With students transiting
the campus on foot, by bike or utilizing our convenient electric shuttle buses, its commitment to
environmental sustainability is strong.

Located in the dynamic metropolis of Shenzhen, China’s Silicon Valley, SUSTech is centered on a
thriving ecosystem of entrepreneurship, innovation and research. Some 43 per cent of the total PCT
patent applications in China came from Shenzhen in 2017, and the city shows no signs of slowing
down. As China’s research and development center, it is the perfect place for entrepreneurs,
researchers and innovators alike to make their home alongside tech giants such as Huawei, Tencent,
BYD, DJI, BJI and Mindray.

Shenzhen is also only distant 17 minutes from Hong Kong city centre by high speed train and about
an hour from Macau by ferry.
The successful candidate will join the recently established AI-Theory Lab in the department of
Computer Science and Engineering with world-leading expertise in bio-inspired computation.

# Candidate Requirements

Applicants must have recently completed a first class (or equivalent) undergraduate degree or a
Masters degree with distinction in Computer Science or close to completion. Outstanding applicants
from Mathematics are also encouraged to apply. The successful applicant must have excellent
analytical and computational skills. He/She must be an excellent team player who can work
independently and communicate well with others. If English is not their first language, they must
have an IELTS score of 6+ overall, with no less than 6.0 in each component or TOEFL of 75+.

Since the project is theoretically challenging, strong mathematical and probability theory skills
are required. This position is open to all qualified candidates independent of nationality.

# Funding and Eligibility

This studentship covers the full tuition fee and provides a tax-free stipend up to RMB 150,000
(approx. GBP 16,000/EUR 19,000) per annum for four years. The studentship also covers free oncampus
accommodation and subsidized on-campus meals in over 10 different cafeterias/canteens as
well as popular western and eastern fast food chains. Funding is available for conference attendance
and collaborative research visits to related organizations world-wide. The AI-Theory Lab at
SUSTech maintains effective collaborations with all the research organisations with major expertise
in the theory of bio-inspired computation world-wide.

# Supervisor Bio

Professor Pietro S. Oliveto is Chair of the **AI-Theory Lab** at SUSTech. His main research interest is
the rigorous performance analysis of bio-inspired computation techniques. He has successfully
supervised PhD projects on the theoretical foundations of evolutionary computation, artificial
immune systems, hyper-heuristics and automatic algorithm configurators.
