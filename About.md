## Qiqi Duan

**My long-term research goal is to build (fully open-source,
multi-level evolved, self-adaptive, open-ended, distributed)
neural-computing systems for recursively self-improving AI,
bio-inspired Intelligent Machines (intelligent robots with
meta-learning and continual learning), self-replicating
Artificial Life, and hierarchically emerging
Swarm Intelligence.**
