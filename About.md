This online website for **evolutionary and swarm Intelligence** was
built by Dr. *Qiqi Duan* and Dr. *Hao Tong*, with kindly helps from
Dr. *Lijun Sun*, Dr. *Zhiwei Xu* etc.

## Qiqi Duan

**My long-term research goal is to build (fully open-source,
multi-level evolved, self-adaptive, open-ended) distributed
neural-computing systems for recursively self-improving AI,
bio-inspired Intelligent Machines (intelligent robots with
meta-learning and continual learning), self-replicating
Artificial Life, and hierarchically emerging
Swarm Intelligence.**
